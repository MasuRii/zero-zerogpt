## What is Zero-ZeroGPT?

Zero-ZeroGPT is a demonstration application that showcases how replacing standard spaces with various Unicode space characters can affect the detection of AI-generated text by common AI detection tools like **GPTZero** and **ZeroGPT**. This project looks to explore the limitations of current AI detection methods and promote discussion about more robust processing techniques.

> **Note:** This version is a fork of the original project. It has been enhanced by **MasuRii** to include full **PDF document support**, whereas the original application only supported plain and rich text.

## AI Detection Approach

Most tools designed to identify text generated by AI models use several techniques:

1. **Pattern Analysis**: Detects unusual word choices, repetitive patterns, and syntactic structures.
2. **Linguistic Analysis**: Examines grammatical structures, coherence, and context to measure inconsistencies.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Compares the statistical distribution of words and phrases to identify anomalies.

## Unicode Spacing Technique

AI detection tools generally tokenize text based on standard spaces. By replacing these spaces with special Unicode characters, it's possible to disrupt the tokenization process:

1. **Tokenization Disruption**: Many detection models split text into tokens based on spaces. When Unicode spaces are used, these tools fail to recognize them as standard spaces.
2. **Statistical Alteration**: The statistical features of the text are changed when spaces are replaced with Unicode spaces, preventing the model from matching the text with its learned patterns.
3. **Pattern Interference**: Unicode spaces can disrupt the detection model's ability to identify typical text patterns.

## PDF Support

Developed by **MasuRii**, this fork introduces robust PDF capabilities to Zero-ZeroGPT. While the original tool was limited to text and rich text inputs, this version allows for full document processing.

Zero-ZeroGPT includes comprehensive PDF processing capabilities, powered by **pdfjs-dist** for extraction and **pdf-lib** for high-fidelity generation.

**Features:**
*   **Layout Preservation**: Maintains the original document's structure, including text positioning, columns, and page dimensions.
*   **Font Awareness**: Intelligently maps original fonts to standard PDF fonts or compatible fallbacks to preserve the document's visual style.
*   **Seamless Transformation**: Apply any Unicode spacing pattern to the text while keeping the document layout intact.
*   **Custom Font Embedding**: Includes high-quality Noto Sans embedding for full Unicode support (including special spaces).
*   **Column Detection**: Automatically detects and preserves multi-column layouts (2-4 columns) commonly found in research papers and articles.
*   **Color Preservation**: Accurately extracts and reproduces text colors from the original document using advanced operator list parsing.
*   **Hybrid Generation**:
    *   **Layout Preserved Mode**: Generates a PDF that mirrors the input (default).
    *   **Simple Text Mode**: Generates a clean, simple text document (fallback).

**Testing:**
The PDF feature suite is backed by a comprehensive testing strategy with **217 tests** covering all utility functions. To run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

**Limitations:**
*   **Text-Based Only**: The feature supports text-based PDFs. Scanned documents or image-only PDFs are not supported (OCR is not implemented).
*   **Font Subsetting**: While font families and styles are preserved, exact custom font files are not re-embedded to avoid copyright and size issues; high-quality standard fallbacks are used instead.

## Examples
